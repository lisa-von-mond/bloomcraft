### about this game

lush:3000 is a game for kids from 9-99 years.
As a future space activist, living in an aera, when earth has became uninhabitable because of climate crisis, your task is to preserve intergalactic species and transport seed ressources from planets to others.
Completing a mission means collecting a package from a certain planet and bring it to a destination planet.

### how to play

Every level surface is a different galaxy. Each galaxy consists of a base planet and further planet scopes, subgroups of lower order planets. Navigate your spaceship based on logic principles. Choose your commands efficiently. Using more commands than allowed or to fire commands, that can not be executed, means level fail.
