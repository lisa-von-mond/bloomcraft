### about this game

lush:3000 is a game for kids from 9-99 years.
As environmental activist of the future, living in an aera, when earth has became uninhabitable because of climate crisis, your task is to preserve intergalactic species and transport seed ressources from planets to others.
The game gives an understanding of coding-principles in a playful way. Program your route in a way so that energy supplies are used consciously and the system will not crash. Save travels, little astronaut!

### about the idea

When I dropped into react, my first thought was creating my own galaxy. Voil√†, here it is! For me, this project was not only about connecting my passion for space with a game idea, but also about developing a game structure, which is as simple as possible, extendible and consistent. I'm currently still in a process of improving, testing, refineing and refactoring the code of lush:3000.
